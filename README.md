#### Challenges
We had some challenges with SQS and lambda when converting our code over. The main thing that took a while was getting docker to connect to everything that was already running in AWS. Getting names, region, keys, and secrets set. Extra resources weren't needed since a person in our group had already done work like this.

#### Features
From what we've tested, all features are working as intended.
